# Freetyme
Freetyme is a project I have started to solve the issue of coordinating a time when all friends in a friend group are free.

### Current Functionality
- You are able to login to your own account
- Add your common sleep and work hours
- Add specific events to a calendar
- View a list of "Freetyme" openings in your schedule

### Roadmap
- Create groups
- Invite friends to a group
- See a combined list of when every member of a group is free
- Import google calendar/other calendar events to remove the need of managing events in multiple place.

This project is a passion/hobby project and a work in progress.
